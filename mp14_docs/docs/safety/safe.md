# Safety

**Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:**

- Always solder in a well-ventilated space to avoid inhaling fumes. Use a fume extractor if possible.

**Wear Protective Gear:**

- **Safety Glasses:** Protect your eyes from solder splashes.
- **Heat-Resistant Gloves:** Prevent burns from the soldering iron and hot solder.

**Use a Proper Soldering Iron Stand:**

- Always place the soldering iron in a stand when not in use to prevent accidental burns and fire hazards.

**Avoid Flammable Materials:**

- Keep your work area clear of flammable materials. Ensure the soldering iron does not come into contact with paper, plastic, or other flammable objects.

**Handle Soldering Iron Carefully:**

- Never touch the tip of the soldering iron. Be mindful of where you place your hands to avoid accidental burns.

**Clean Soldering Tip Regularly:**

- Use a damp sponge or brass wire cleaner to keep the soldering tip clean, ensuring efficient and safe soldering.

**Avoid Inhaling Solder Fumes:**

- Use lead-free solder to minimize health risks. Ensure good ventilation or use a fume extractor.

**Properly Dispose of Waste:**

- Dispose of used solder and electronic components according to local regulations. Do not throw them in regular trash.

**Use Appropriate Sanding Tools:**

- Use fine-grit sandpaper to remove the insulator layer. Avoid using power tools, as they can remove too much material and generate excessive dust.

**Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:**

- Sand in a well-ventilated space to ensure you are not breathing in copper dust. An outdoor workspace is ideal.

**Clean Up Properly:**

- After sanding, clean the work area thoroughly to remove copper dust. Wash your hands and any exposed skin to avoid prolonged contact with copper particles.

**Avoid Excessive Force:**

- Apply gentle, even pressure while sanding to avoid damaging the wire and to maintain control of the sanding process.

**Store Tools Safely:**

- After use, store sandpaper and other tools in a safe place to prevent accidental contact.
